# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Biome

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite. Uses Typescript + SWC configuration with Tailwind CSS and Biome for formatting and linting.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/)

## Biome - What? Why?
- Biome is a replacement for eslint + prettier. It can do everything both of these combined do.
- I got fed up of the issues that come with setting up eslint with prettier, and it felt cumbersome to install so many packages to support all this.
